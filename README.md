## Election-Audit Summary:
### Summary Statement

Having built this script I believe that it can be used for various elections where we are looking to know similar data. Two ways this script could be modified to be used for other elections are 1. This script can be motified to include more than 3 counties and also include more candidates in future elections. 2. The script could also be motified to have different results posted to different txt files. For instances, we could have all the county data written to one file and all the candidate data written to another if we would like to seperate the data.
